   * You will need modify the HTML so that you can target HTML elements o the page.
   *
   * You will be toggling the comments on the page.
   * If the comments are hidden, this should happen when the user clicks on the "View Comments" button:
   * 1. The comment section should appear
   * 2. The "View Comments" button will change to say "Hide Comments"
   *
   * If the comments are visible, this should happen when the user clicks on the "Hide Comments" button:
   * 1. The comments sections should disappear
   * 2. The "Hide Comments" button should change to say "View Comments"
   *
   * HINT: Right now, the comments are hidden because they have the class ".hidden",
   * but you can switch up the HTML so that it uses inline styles if you like.
